Web Services
SOAP web service and Rest

SOAP(JAX-WS java API for XML web service)
	--Simple object Access protocol 
	-- Newer version of java11 isnot supported
	Only XML out put 

Rest(JAX-rs JAVA API RESTful webservice)
	--Representaional state transfer webservice
	--Light Weight 
	JSON and XML it can be text or anything 

A webservice available on network and uses a standardized messaging system.

Why webservice
	The webservice is the channel between the user and the DB will have the limited access to the DB.

Overview
	-- Standard Application where all the services are available no need to access the network 
	-- When come to web services the client can access the webservices will deploy over network and the client can access the services over the network 	
	-- A service can be independent then its a microserive is a strong dominating 

Website is a service on network when you visit two way communication 

Webservice  --  Cilent will communicate with the API (classes, methods Standard DATA) is for machine consumption 

HTTP protocol is used to communicate the webservices over the network


URI patterns -- 

Example Scenario 

ACTION BASED URI's
Showroom there are multiple bikes different brands also provides differnt spare parts based on the brand. 
		
		Showroom -> Brands 
					  ^
					/	\
				   |	 |
			   Bikes	 Spares 

			  URI patterns we get INFO and SET info 

			  Ex. One to many what all brands bikes available in showroom /getBikes
			  Ex. One to many what all brands brands available in showroom /getBrands
			  /getBikes?brand = honda
			  /getSpared?brand = suzuki
			  /getSpare?id = 25

			 If you want to set some information of the bikes in the DB

			 /setBrands
			 /setBikes

These are not Resource based URIS they are action based URI's 


Resource Based URIS

List down all the brands /Brands
List down specific brands /Brands/bajaj
Specific Resorce id /Spare/25


There is an issue there is no action in the URI no set and get 
Then client no need to know about the get set they should know about methods called HTTP method
how client software know failure or success known as HTTP status codes

Status codes 

200OK if everything is good
404 Not found -- URL non exsit then is issue will return 
500 Internal server error

1XX - Informational
2XX - Successful
3XX - Redirection
4XX - Client Error 
5XX - Server Error 

more about resources based URI 

File based links are also known as static links

Resource based links called dynamic links 

Collection URI 

Travel.com/cities -> collection of all cities 

Filter based URI

List down all cities starts with M 

Travel.com/cities/startswith=m etc., 



URI relationships
 
REST Responses
	Which we get from REST server
	Cient and SERVER information transfer between the we can represent info in different forms
	Representation is on HTTP based on 1.0 we have to use HTTP in REST

JSON javaScript object Notation 
XML 


HATEOAS
	Hypermedia as the engine of the application state 
		--Hyper Text that contains links to other text 
		--Hyper Media is the extension of hypertext text, audio, image, image, txt etc, 


Richardson maturity model 
	Fill Restful
	No Restful
	Partial

Level 0 - Not a Restful API -- Not Restful
	Not uses URI, HTTP methods, and HATEOAS capabilities
	Single URI and singele HTTP method is used 
	transfers SOAP bases payloads 
	uses plain old XML(POX)
	Actions in inside the request body - in XML complex scenarios 
	Ex - URI http://showroom/manage is the URL is a messi API 

Level 1 Multiple URI and Single VERB  VERBS are (get, post, put, delete) PArtial REST
	Makes uses of URI based resource
	/cars, /brands
	Single HTTP verb, usually POST we will perform the action will be inside your request 

Level 2 Multilple URI and VERBS PARTIAL REST
	 
	 HTTP verbs, methods 

Level 3 multiple URIS and methods  and HATEOAS concepts Fully Restful APIS  -- FULLY RESTFUL 

JAX rs is the specificaation, Annotation and interfaces to build RESTful API

Implementation part is different 

JAX - RS 

JAX-rs sit between Application and Implementation 

Implementation part may be some thrid party providers like Apache CXF, Jersy,  RESt easy. REsetlet etc, implement JAXrs (specification will come along with the implementation of the third party).

api, users are the resources and you can call it as the URI's
