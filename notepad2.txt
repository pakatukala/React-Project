Necessity of Bundlers and Transpilers
	
	Bundlers
		-- consists of multiple js files makes one -- parcel is kind of bundler 
		-- there are other bundlers webpack, browser5 

		we can write the imports in js to avoid messup in HTML injection of src = index.js

	Transpilers
		-- Babel - converts JSX to browser understandable to browsers

		JSX -- <div></div>  converts to React.createElement('div', null, 'React element')
